# Calculator

## Description
A simple 4-function calculator made to perform basic arithmetic, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and dvision.

In addition to these functions, the calculator is also capable of handling decimals, exponents, and positive/negative conversions.

Aside from being able to clear all text on the screen with 'AC', the calculator is also able to perform simple backspaces with the clear (C) button. This is particularly made for increasing the user experience, and allowing the user to quickly fix their errors without having to redo the entire calculation.
